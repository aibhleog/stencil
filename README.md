# just some code

if you want the `smoothing.py` module for smoothing 1D spectra, you can find that [here](https://github.com/aibhleog/simply-spectra/blob/master/smoothing.py)


### NOTE:  
Need to update spectra units in all scripts to MJy/sr and THEN convert to cgs units.  Currently I was assuming the spectra were in units of MJy.
